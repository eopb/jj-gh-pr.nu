# jj-gh-pr.nu

Nushell command for quickly opening [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) PRs with [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

This script is opinionated and contains some flags that may only be useful to me.
If others want to contribute, I'm open to making the script more general.

## Usage

Add the `jjpr` command to your shell

```nu
source jjpr.nu
```

Run `jjpr`

```
jjpr --help
```
